# Ironfarm

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Ironfarm is the first project of me during the nine week web dev bootcamp with Ironhack (Berlin). I had five days to build it and started after being in the bootcamp for two weeks.

<h2> What is Ironfarm?</h2>

It is a farming game in pixelart with soundtrack, sounds and actions. It even has a story! You can move around, work on your fields, earn some cash and maybe even find hidden treasures.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

I used HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript.
